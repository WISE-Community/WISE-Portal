teacher.termsofuse.10A=In the interest of intellectual freedom, WISE allows members to contribute comments and links to public spaces, but to function as a community we insist that users be considerate and respectful of one another.  If you find any content posted by another WISE member to be offensive or inappropriate, please contact WISE support
teacher.termsofuse.10B=contact WISE
teacher.termsofuse.10C=and we will investigate.  Users who abuse their WISE membership privileges may have their accounts terminated.   
teacher.termsofuse.11=Finally, your participation in the WISE community is voluntary, and you are free to halt your WISE membership at any time.
teacher.termsofuse.12=We value your enthusiastic participation in the WISE community and its related research endeavors.  If you have any questions about our research or policies, please contact our project director. 
teacher.termsofuse.13=Sincerely, 
teacher.termsofuse.14=Marcia Linn, Project Director 
teacher.termsofuse.2=WISE Usage Agreement
teacher.termsofuse.3=The following information describes terms of use for the WISE system.
teacher.termsofuse.5=Before proceeding, we would like to explain our community and the role you'll play within the WISE research environment.  Please take a moment to read this page, as it is very important.  
teacher.termsofuse.6=By joining the WISE Online Community, you are joining a community that serves several federally-funded research projects, and we seek your consent to use your contributions to this community as part of this research.  We may use your comments, communities, or surveys in our research, and we will keep track of some of your actions on our site to help us find ways to improve.  In addition, your students' work (free from identification) may be analyzed to address research questions about the effectiveness of specific curriculum content or elements of the online environment.  
teacher.termsofuse.7=By checking the "I agree to the terms of use" box on the registration page, you will be consenting to participation in our research regarding teacher and scientist beliefs about technology and the Internet, as well as best ways to support community members as they prepare to use WISE projects and author WISE curricula.  You also consent to our use in our research of your written contributions to surveys and community discussions.  If participating in specific research projects that use the WISE platform, you consent to using WISE as part of these project-specific materials.   
teacher.termsofuse.8=We do not anticipate risks related to teachers and students joining the WISE community other than those inherent to the web itself -- namely the possible exploration of indecent or inappropriate material on unrelated websites.  This risk is handled at school sites, which have security/filtering systems.  WISE benefits from these security systems and our curriculum provides structure and content that reduces the risk of haphazard searching. 
teacher.termsofuse.9=We will not release your identify in any of our research.  Likewise, your students' identities will never be viewed or revealed.  All community comments will be treated as anonymous in our analyses.  Anytime we seek to use your identity in conjunction with comments (e.g., as a teacher quote on our public pages), we will first seek your permission.

teacherfaq.contact-q=Who do I contact when I have a problem I can't solve?
teacherfaq.encorage-students-review-a=Many teachers find it advantageous to grade the first step or two at the end of the first day of the project run. At the beginning of class the next day they share with the whole class some sample responses and have the class critique the work. Then when the students sign in they are directed to go to the My Work link before starting on the project to review your comments and grades.
teacherfaq.encorage-students-review-q=How can I encourage my students to review the graded notes and comments I have made?
teacherfaq.find-time-grade-a1=We recommend that you go through the project and select a few steps that you think best demonstrate the students' understanding of the complex concepts covered in the module. You can then go to the Gradinglink and edit the Point Values for each question.   For example, you could most steps in the project worth just 1-2 pts while a few key steps are worth 20 points.  Then tell your students they must complete all questions but should concentrate their efforts on the key questions.  We recognize that critically grading each step is very time consuming.

teacherfaq.how-long-run-project-a=Project durations vary from about 3 days to 10 days. See the information panel for a project for more details.  Note that some WISE4 projects may differ in their Total Time (the expected hours to complete the entire project) versus the Computer Time (the expected hours of active time on the computer; some projects will include paper-based activities for some days).
teacherfaq.how-long-run-project-q=How long does it take to run a project?
teacherfaq.how-to-clear-cache=How to clear your cache (opens in new tab)
teacherfaq.nav-bar-disappear-a=When the students are running the project there is a button at the top of the page labeled "Full Screen". When you click on it the project page takes the the full area doing away with the navigation bar.  The students then use the green arrows (top left) to navigate. Clicking on it again will bring back the navigation bar.
teacherfaq.nav-bar-disappear-q=Often the navigation bar on the left side of the page is disappearing on students' screens. What are they doing that is making this happen, and how do I get it back?
teacherfaq.num-computers-a1=We strongly recommend one computer for each two students. We know from research that students benefit from working together as a team of two.
teacherfaq.num-computers-q=How many computers do I need to run WISE?

teacherfaq.project-management=Project Management
teacherfaq.register-student-a1=WISE makes student registration simple and intuitive -- direct your student to the the WISE4 home page and provide them with their Access Code, and they should be able to register in 10 minutes or less.   However, you can also opt to pre-register all of your students and provide them with a copy of their Username/Password on their first day in the project run.
teacherfaq.register-student-a2=Once a student has created a WISE 4 account they should never need to create another one.
teacherfaq.register-student-a3=Some teachers that pre-register prefer to give all students the same initial password, to decrease problems with students signing.  Note that students can later change their password if they so desire.
teacherfaq.register-student-q=Should I register my students for WISE or have them do it themselves?
teacherfaq.review-grade-work-a1=Sign in with your teacher Username/Password.
teacherfaq.review-grade-work-a2=Look in the table of active project runs on the right side of the screen.
teacherfaq.review-grade-work-a3=Click the Grade by Step or Grade by Teamlink for a particular project run.  The following screens will present all current student work (with color highlighting of new/revised work).  You can make comments which the student will see inside their MY WORK panel.  You can also score student work.
teacherfaq.review-grade-work-q=How do I review and grade student work?
teacherfaq.rubric-a1=The following link will give you a sample rubric for grading a step in the Mitosis and Cell Processes project.

teacherfaq.rubric-q=What should I look for in my student's answers?
teacherfaq.student-forgets-username-a1=First, we recommend always having students WRITE DOWN their Username/Password when they first register.
teacherfaq.student-forgets-username-a2=Second, encourage the students to solve the problem themselves.  Tell them to go to the WISE4 home page, click the Lost UserName /Password link, and click the Student button.  If the student can answer their security question (created at registration) they can reassign their password.  If the student has the Access Code they should be able to find their Username associated with the project run.
teacherfaq.student-forgets-username-a3=Third, if the student can't solve the problem directly, you can look up their Username or change their Password.  On the Teacher Dashboard home page click a link in the student column a particular period in a particular project run.  Click the Info button to see the student's Username.   Click Password to assign the student a new password.
teacherfaq.student-forgets-username-q=A student has forgotten his/her Username or Password.  What should I do?
teacherfaq.student-management=Student Management
teacherfaq.students-see-comments-a1=Have the student sign in using their Username/Password.
teacherfaq.students-see-comments-a2=Have the student click Run Project for your project run.

teacherfaq.title=WISE Teacher Frequently Asked Questions
teacherfaq.trouble-logging-in-a1=If you do not remember your Username or password click the Lost Username or Password link and follow the instructions.  Note that your Username does not include a space between first and last name (unlike WISE 2). 
teacherfaq.trouble-logging-in-a2=You will also want to turn off any firewall software that may be blocking your access to the site.
teacherfaq.trouble-logging-in-q=What if I have trouble logging in?
teacherfaq.when-set-up-run-a=You need to set up your project run prior to the students signing in, in order to generate an Access Code.   Students cannot register for your project run until you provide them with its Access Code.
teacherfaq.when-set-up-run-q=When should I set up my project run?

teacherfaq.where-lesson-plan-a2=How do I fit a WISE project into my curriculum?
teacherfaq.where-lesson-plan-a3=In general students will benefit from some pre-teaching of the topic covered in the project. It is really up to the teacher to decide where it best fits to support student learning. Many teachers use a WISE project as a capstone activity while others integrate it into their curriculum at a midpoint. Some teachers elect to use WISE projects an introductory activity for a unit, or as a summation activity for a unit.
teacherfaq.where-lesson-plan-q=Where do I find out about lesson plans and standards for WISE 4 projects?
teacherfaq.wise-2-a1=At the present time if you are running a WISE 2.0 project you will need to user the older WISE 2.0 environment.  (http\://wise.berkeley.edu)
teacherfaq.wise-2-a2=You can also contact us to request a conversion of your WISE2 project into the new WISE 4 format.
teacherfaq.wise-2-a3=We hope to offer an automated tool that will allow WISE2 users to convert their projects to the WISE4 format.

teacher.termsofuse.weDoNotAnticipate=We do not anticipate risks related to teachers and students joining the WISE community other than those inherent to the web itself -- namely the possible exploration of indecent or inappropriate material on unrelated websites.  This risk is handled at school sites, which have security/filtering systems.  WISE benefits from these security systems and our curriculum provides structure and content that reduces the risk of haphazard searching.
teacher.termsofuse.weWillNotReleaseYourIdentity=We will not release your identify in any of our research.  Likewise, your students' identities will never be viewed or revealed.  All community comments will be treated as anonymous in our analyses.  Anytime we seek to use your identity in conjunction with comments (e.g., as a teacher quote on our public pages), we will first seek your permission.
teacher.termsofuse.inTheInterest=In the interest of intellectual freedom, WISE allows members to contribute comments and links to public spaces, but to function as a community we insist that users be considerate and respectful of one another.  If you find any content posted by another WISE member to be offensive or inappropriate, please contact WISE support
teacher.termsofuse.contactWise=contact WISE
teacher.termsofuse.andWeWillInvestigate=and we will investigate.  Users who abuse their WISE membership privileges may have their accounts terminated.
teacher.termsofuse.finallyYourParticipation=Finally, your participation in the WISE community is voluntary, and you are free to halt your WISE membership at any time.
teacher.termsofuse.weValueYourEnthusiastic=We value your enthusiastic participation in the WISE community and its related research endeavors.  If you have any questions about our research or policies, please contact our project director.
teacher.termsofuse.sincerely=Sincerely,
